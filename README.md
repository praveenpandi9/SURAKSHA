# Suraksha - Women Safety App

Suraksha is an Android app prototype designed to enhance the safety and security of women in society. It aims to provide quick and efficient assistance in times of distress.

## Application Flow:
1. **Sign Up/Sign In**: Upon first opening the app, users have the option to sign up or sign in. The sign-up form collects essential details including email, phone number, and most importantly, an emergency contact number.

2. **Discussion Forum**: After signing up, users are directed to a discussion forum where other app users share their past experiences of incidents, including location, date, and time. This feature helps users stay informed about potentially unsafe areas and allows them to share their own experiences.

3. **Emergency SMS**: A key feature of the app is the ability to send an emergency SMS to the designated contact number by performing a "DOUBLE KARATE CHOP" action on the phone or shaking the mobile device vigorously.

4. **Integration with Voice Assistants**: Suraksha integrates with voice assistants to enable users to send distress signals without needing to physically interact with their phones. By issuing a predefined command to a voice assistant (e.g., "Alexa, tell Suraksha I'm feeling unsafe"), users can trigger the emergency SMS feature.

5. **GPS-Based Functionality**: Suraksha operates based on GPS, enabling users to send their location along with the distress signal, ensuring prompt assistance regardless of data connectivity.

6. **IoT Integration**: With the increasing popularity of IoT devices and voice assistants in Indian households, Suraksha aims to leverage this technology to enhance user safety.

7. **Data Storage**: User data is securely stored on Google's Firebase database.

This application is a proactive step towards empowering women and providing them with a reliable safety tool in challenging situations.
